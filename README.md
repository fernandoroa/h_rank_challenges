### Magic Square

Considering the h. rank example:  
[[5, 3, 4], [1, 5, 8], [6, 4, 2]]  
which illustrates what is a magic square, by summing 15 (cost 7)

8 3 4  
1 5 9  
6 7 2

Its less costly solution would be  
[[6, 3, 3], [1, 4, 7],[ 5, 5, 2]] with a cost of 6  
summing 12

The example is ok because it is only to show a magic square. But, if this example by some reason appeared as a test case, a solution based on 15 would be invalid.
